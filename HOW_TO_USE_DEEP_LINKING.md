# 🔗 How to Use Deep Linking in Tmleen

Deep linking allows you to share direct links to your products that open directly in your branded store view.

## 🎯 Format
The standard format for deep links is:
```
https://tmleen.com/@username/product-slug
```

## 📝 Examples

### **1. Sharing a Course**
If your username is `ahmed-coach` and you have a course "Web Development":
- **Link:** `tmleen.com/@ahmed-coach/web-development`
- **Result:** Opens the product page directly with your branding (colors, avatar) and NO distraction.

### **2. Sharing an E-book**
If your username is `sara-design` and you have a product "Logo Templates":
- **Link:** `tmleen.com/@sara-design/logo-templates`
- **Result:** Direct purchase page for the e-book.

## 🛠️ How to Find Your Links?

1. Go to **Dashboard > Products**.
2. Click the **Eye Icon** (👁️) next to any product.
3. The link that opens is your **Direct Deep Link**.
4. Copy the URL and share it on Instagram, Twitter, or WhatsApp.

## 🎨 Branding Your Links

Your deep links automatically use your brand settings:
1. Go to **Dashboard > Settings**.
2. Set your **Brand Color**.
3. Add your **Bio** and **Avatar**.
4. These will appear on all your deep links!
